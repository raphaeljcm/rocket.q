## Changes 
I have been studying backend for a while and this project helped me to practice everything. Rocketseat gave everything working fine so what I did was made a refactoring and put all my knowledge into it. I made updates on the frontend and also on the backend as follows:
- Put everything the way I like 
- Architeture, I changed it completely to something I find it easy to understand
- The database, they used SQL Lite, I changed it to MongoDB
- I used bcryptjs to make the passwords more secure
- I used Joi package to make a double validation 
- To do -> add Socket.io here and make the room page works real time
